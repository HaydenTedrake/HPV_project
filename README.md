# Hypervelocity Star Trajectory Analysis

This project explores the origins of hypervelocity stars by modeling their dynamics and simulating potential ejection scenarios. The goal is to investigate whether the trajectories of these stars can be traced back to past interactions with dwarf galaxies.

The work involves computational simulations of stellar orbits under various galactic potentials, with a focus on identifying plausible sources of ejection.

Supervised by Jesse Han and Professor Lars Hernquist.
